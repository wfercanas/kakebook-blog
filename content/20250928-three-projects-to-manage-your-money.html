      <h1>Three Projects for Managing Your Money</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          It's hard to manage something that cannot be seen. You need to see
          your money and how you use it before you can get better at managing
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've tried using a single project/book to keep track of all my
          expenses, but I've found myself trapped many times in so many details
          that I eventually stopped keeping track of my money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I think it would be better to manage money using three separate
          projects. These projects are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="#personal-project">Personal Project</a></li>
          <li><a href="#investment-project">Investment Project</a></li>
          <li><a href="#home-project">Home Project</a></li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Let's see their core characteristics:</p>

        <h3 id="personal-project">Personal Project</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>This project tracks personal expenses only.</li>
          <li>
            Has some categories in which you tend to spend money. Mark each
            expense under a single category.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start each month by adding some money to the project. The rest of
            the month is just about registering how you used it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you need more money during the month it's okay. Add more if you
            have it available.
          </li>
          <li>Dedicate 10-15 minutes daily to keep the records up to date.</li>
          <li>
            Don't overcomplicate it by recording entries with too much detail or
            complex figures.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="investment-project">Investment Project</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>This project exists only to handle your investments.</li>
          <li>This project usually doesn't have too many movements.</li>
          <li>
            Add money on a regular basis, invest it right away, and let time and
            compound interest do their magic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create categories if you have more than one kind of investment.
          </li>
          <li>Dedicate 5-10 minutes monthly to keep it up to date</li>
          <li>Whenever you do an investment, record it right away.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="home-project">Home Project</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Expenses here tend to be regular, since they typically are related
            to your bills.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, there may be some unexpected situations that are important
            to resolve and record.
          </li>
          <li>Record each expense right away.</li>
          <li>
            Group your expenses according to the day you pay them. Try to create
            the minimal amount of groups. It will reduce the days you must
            register movements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dedicate 5-10 minutes each month to check that these expenses look
            like the ones from last month.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Budget</h2>
        <p>
          If you have all your money in cash (rare nowadays), you can split the
          money into three. Assign some of it to each project.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have your money in a bank account, try to split it into three
          pockets. One pocket for each project.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also have three different bank accounts, one per project.
          Although this can improve the control of your money, keep in mind that
          it may carry some costs.
        </p>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          The first month is just about starting. Take a guess at the budget and
          start.
        </p>
        <p>
          The important part comes from month two onwards. Check how well you
          managed your money last month and make corrections.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point here is to make improvements, whether they are big or small
          ones. It doesn't matter as long as you keep learning.
        </p>
        <p>Try new things and see their results.</p>
        <p>
          Try not to invest less than 10% of your income. Have it as your
          baseline.
        </p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
